    * Convolutional neural network (CNN)
    * Variational Autoencoder  (VAE)
    * Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
    * Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW)

Stochastic gradient descent variants:
    * SGD with momentum 
    * SGD Langevin dynamics
    * Rmsprop
    * Adam
    * Adam with gradient clipping

Supervised training on:
    * MNIST

Unsupervised training on:
